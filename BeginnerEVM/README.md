# Create a Token 
This project serves as a requirement for the ETH-Proof Beginner course by Metacrafters. 
Elementary Solidity concepts such as variables, mappings, and functions, were applied to 
complete this project.  

# Description
The PokeTokenMinter is a smart contract that creates and manages PokeTokens, a Pokemon-inspired Tokens. 
The contract declares three state variables: the name and the abbreviation of the Token, and its total supply
in circulation. It also has a mapping variable that records the PokeToken balances of addresses. 
The contract defines two functions which increases and decreases the amount of tokens of a balance account and 
the total supply. 

# Getting Started 

# Executing the program 

To run the Solidity program, Remix, an online Soldity IDE, must be used (https://remix.ethereum.org/).
